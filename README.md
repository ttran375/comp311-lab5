1. In the Checkstyle violations view, double-click the two violations
    noted in **step 10** to find the two occurrences of this problem.
    One occurs in class **UserPrompter** in method **getYesNoAnswer()**.
    Where does the other appear:

    a. Class  \_ Method \_

    b. How would you improve the code in the method you just named?

2. What is the most common type of violation still reported by
    Checkstyle?

    a. There are  \_ occurrences of

    b. Can you figure out how to disable checking for this violation? What module (Checkstyle category) \_ and specific check \_must you ignore?

3. How did you change the code to remove the violation in step 13? Copy the improved line(s) of code here:

4. There is one occurrence of an inline conditional.

    a. What operator is an inline conditional? \_ Hint: give the operator symbols

    b. Why is using the inline operator considered poor form? (Give and explanation or name the ISO 9126 quality characteristic it offends)

1. In the Checkstyle violations view, double-click the Cyclomatic
    complexity violation, to see the list of occurrences of this
    problem. Where does it occur?

    a. What is the class name  \_ and method name \_

    b. What is the cyclomatic number reported for this method? \_

    c. Does the reported cyclomatic number agree with the complexity calculated using the technique given in class? Circle: Yes or No. If no, what number did you calculate by manually  \_
